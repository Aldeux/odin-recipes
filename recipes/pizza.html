                    The edges needs to be wider than the rest of the pizza to have a crust.</li>

                <li>When the bottom becomes brown, it's time to threw the cheese on top, you can turn off your oven or put it at minimum.</li>
                <li>When the cheese is melted, then the pizza is done to be served.</li>
